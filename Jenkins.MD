# Continous Integration
=====================
* What is CI --> It is the process integrating the code into artifact/image continously, means when developer do some commit, we can clone the code, install the dependencies, we can build the code, we can scan the code, we can unit testing finally we will build it as image

Continuous Integration = Automatically building and testing code every time developer makes a change.
CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment) = Automatically delivering or deploying tested code to servers.

## Jenkins is popular CI tool. The real power jenkins lies in plugins.
