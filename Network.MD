# Path to Becoming a Senior DevOps Engineer at Jio

## üåê How Data Generates Income for YouTube

When you watch a video on YouTube:
1. You use your **mobile data (2GB)** to download video and ads.
2. YouTube earns money from **advertisers**, not directly from your data.
3. Your **ISP (like Jio)** provides internet access; they charge you for data.
4. The **advertiser** pays YouTube for showing ads.
5. A small portion of data is consumed to download these ads.

### Summary:
- **You pay** your ISP for data.
- **ISP pays** global internet providers for bandwidth.
- **YouTube earns** from ads, not from your data usage.

## üì¶ How Data Travels in Packets

When you play a YouTube video:
1. The video file is **broken into small packets**.
2. Each packet contains:
   - Source IP (YouTube server)
   - Destination IP (your phone)
   - Sequence number (so packets can be reassembled in order)
3. Packets travel through many **routers** and **servers** across the internet.
4. Your device **reassembles packets** to form the full video stream.

Think of it like this:
> A video = 1000 puzzle pieces (packets).  
> Each piece travels on a different road (network path).  
> When all reach you, your phone puts them together.

---

## ‚ö° Why Packets Move So Fast

- Packets move at the **speed of light** through fiber-optic cables.
- Routers only take **microseconds** to forward packets.
- Billions of packets travel every second worldwide.

You can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù packets directly, but tools like **Wireshark** or **Ping/Traceroute** show how they move.

## üõ∞Ô∏è How Jio Handles Huge Network Traffic

Jio buys **massive internet bandwidth** from global providers (e.g., Tata Communications, Level 3, Airtel).  
They build **data centers**, **fiber-optic networks**, and **mobile towers**.

Every user‚Äôs data passes through:
1. **Jio Tower (BTS)** ‚Üí 2. **Jio Core Network** ‚Üí 3. **Data Center** ‚Üí 4. **Internet Backbone**

To manage this, Jio uses:
- Load balancers
- Routers/switches
- Cloud servers
- Automation tools

And yes, they need **DevOps engineers** to manage and automate this infrastructure.
